  <h1>Interactive Experience Research Project</h1>
  <h2>Part1: Research</h2>
 <!--Class tag been use here to order the styles-->
 <!--I've separated the questions and answers into two different styles.-->
    <p class="question">Q1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
    <p class="answer">The first thing I paid attention to was the smooth scrolling interactive animation.
      It immediately caught my eye because of how fluid and responsive it felt. The way the content subtly moved and transformed as I scrolled gave the site a sense of depth and motion, making it feel more like an experience than just a webpage.</p>
    <p class="question">Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p>
    <ol class="answer">
      <!--Cause it says make a list,so i use the Ordered lists  -->
     <li>Landed on the homepage and noticed the animated title “The Gehry Archive.”</li>
     <li>Scrolled down to ulti-angle display interaction of the exterior of the building</li>
     <li>Hovered over a project thumbnail to see it respond visually.</li>
     <li>Scrolled down to the interview video,and check its details</li>
     <li>Watched the transition animation into the project’s detail view.</li>
     <li> Scrolled through sketches, models, and notes inside the project.</li>
     <li>Clicked on a sketch to view it in higher resolution.</li>
     <li>Closed the image overlay to return to the project overview.</li>
     <li>Used the site menu or logo to return to the main navigation screen.</li>
     <li>Scrolled horizontally to explore more archived projects.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="question">Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
    <p class="answer">I also engaged heavily with the subpage transitions—clicking into project sections and observing how the site uses smooth animations and layering to guide users through the information. The continuous scrolling interaction, both vertical and horizontal, was something I kept returning to, as it played a key role in how I navigated and uncovered new visual elements.</p>
    <p class="question">Q4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
    <p class="answer">The most common action during my two-minute interaction was scrolling.
      Scrolling was central to the entire experience—it wasn’t just for moving through content but also triggered smooth animations, revealed new sections, and guided the flow of interaction. The site uses both vertical and horizontal scrolling in a way that feels natural and intuitive, making it the primary method of exploration.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
    <p class="answer">My impression is that the primary goal of the interactive experience is to immerse users in Frank Gehry’s creative process through intuitive, visually rich, and exploratory interactions.</p>
    <p class="question">Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
    <p class="answer">The use of animations, scroll-triggered transitions, and layered content encourages users to explore deeper into the gallery. Instead of presenting information all at once, the site reveals it gradually, making the discovery feel more personal and immersive—just like exploring an artist’s or architect’s body of work.</p>
   
    <p class="question">Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>
    <p class="answer">My impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time is that it encourages repeated engagement, with users spending short, focused sessions exploring the content.
      Given the dynamic, immersive nature of the site, it seems that users should interact with it in multiple short visits, each lasting around 3–5 minutes. This allows them to absorb specific details without feeling overwhelmed. The interactive elements, including the smooth animations and 3D models, suggest that returning to the site several times will offer a deeper understanding of Gehry’s work. Each visit could reveal new aspects or offer a fresh perspective, making it more engaging with each interaction.</p>
    <p class="question">Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
    <p class="answer">The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time through its pacing and content transitions.
      The gradual unfolding of content via smooth scrolling and animations invites users to spend time exploring each section. As users interact with different projects, the experience’s subtle transitions—whether in the form of 3D models, sketches, or project details—suggest a deeper exploration over multiple sessions. The frequent visual changes, combined with engaging content layers, encourage users to return, allowing them to absorb information piece by piece and immerse themselves in Gehry’s design process gradually.
      </p>
    <p class="question">Q9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
      <ul class="answer">
        <li>Video</li>
        <li>Sketches</li>
        <li>Text animations </li>
        <li>3d models</li>
        <Li>Audio work</Li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Part2: Reflection</h2>
    <p class="question">Q10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</p>
    <p class="answer">The reference to these various media forms communicates that I should approach my research experience with a mindset of exploration and discovery.
      Just like flipping through an architect's sketchbook or walking through a physical exhibition, the experience encourages active engagement with the content. It suggests that I should take my time, explore the details, and interact with the different layers of information gradually. The combination of digital interactivity and traditional media forms emphasizes the value of both analytical exploration (looking at detailed sketches and blueprints) and creative discovery (engaging with 3D models and animations). This approach reminds me that research can be an immersive, evolving process, where insights are revealed piece by piece.
      </p>
    <p class="question">Q11: hat does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</p>
    <p class="answer">The reference to these various media forms communicates that I should feel curious, immersed, and reflective when engaging with my research experience.
      The mix of digital interactivity and traditional media encourages a feeling of exploration, similar to wandering through an art gallery or architect's studio. It conveys that research should be an active, almost sensory experience—one that invites me to engage with the content not just analytically, but also emotionally and creatively. The gradual unfolding of information through animations and models suggests a sense of discovery, where each new layer of content sparks curiosity and invites deeper reflection on the subject.
      </p>
    <p class="question">Q12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>
    <p class="answer">The most frustrating part of the interaction is that while the flashy animation effects are visually captivating, they can be a bit of a hindrance for users trying to search for specific information.
      The large, dynamic visuals are stunning, but for someone trying to focus on detailed text, such as the modern minimalist fonts used on the site, it can take a bit longer to locate the necessary information. The text is often quite small, and the animated transitions between sections might make it harder to quickly find and read the content. This could delay the search process for users who prefer a more straightforward, text-based navigation experience.</p>
    <p class="question">Q13: What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</p>
    <p class="answer">The most satisfying part of the interaction was the smoothness and responsiveness of the scrolling and animation transitions.
      As I navigated through the content, the seamless movement between sections, especially when interacting with 3D models and detailed sketches, felt immersive and fluid. The transitions allowed me to feel like I was uncovering layers of Gehry's creative process, making the experience feel more dynamic and engaging. The sense of discovery as new content gradually revealed itself added to the satisfaction, making the whole experience feel like an interactive journey.
